Readme file for the replication codes

"Discretizing Unobserved Heterogeneity", by Bonhomme, Lamadon and Manresa

The folder contains 6 matlab files:

Code_Earnings_Time_Invariant.m replicates Figure 1 in the paper and Table S1 in the Supplemental Material

Code_Probit_Time_Varying.m replicates Figure 2 in the paper and Table S2 in the Supplemental Material

Code_Probit_Time_Invariant_BinaryCov.m replicates Table S3 in the Supplemental Material

lik.m, lik_bb.m, and lik_IFE2.m are functions to compute the likelihood function and scores & hessians of probit models

Thank you for using our codes.
